This is the design of a breakout macropad, that can be used for multiplayer games. Instead of reaching to wasd and the arrow keys this module is intended to be used, and is customizable. 
The case for the multipad is below. The bottom case has room for the USB port of the XIAO, as well as a hole to insert threaded m3 brackets. The top case is intended to be secure to the bottom via m3 screws.

The schmematic and pcb layout are below. The central microcontroller is a XIAO ESP32 that is mounted via through-hole. The switches to be mounted are mx switches, and the keys can either be custom printed or store-bought. Two programmable LEDs are also mounted in case, and can be fit to specific requirements.
